# Bacteria Evolution Simulation

An interactive web-based simulation for observing and experimenting with bacterial evolution under different environmental conditions.

## 🔬 Live Demo

[Try the simulation here](https://wuwvzkog.manus.space)

## ✨ Features

- Real-time bacterial evolution simulation
- Adjustable environmental parameters (temperature, pH, nutrients)
- Customizable bacterial properties (growth rate, mutation rate)
- Multiple visualization modes (bacteria, nutrients, temperature, pH)
- Detailed statistics tracking (population, genetic diversity, fitness)
- Interactive selection of individual bacteria to view genetic details

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bacteria-evolution-simulation.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd bacteria-evolution-simulation

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start the development server
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## 🧪 Experimentation Guide

1. **Environmental Stress**: Try setting extreme temperature or pH values
2. **Nutrient Gradients**: Create nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor areas
3. **Evolution Speed**: Increase the mutation rate to accelerate evolution
4. **Selection Pressure**: Combine challenging conditions with high mutation rates
5. **Flow Effects**: Observe how environmental flow affects bacterial distribution

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- React.js for UI components
- D3.js for data visualization
- Custom physics engine for environmental simulation
- Genetic algorithms for bacterial evolution
